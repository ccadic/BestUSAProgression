Best USA Progressions
Software Description:

Best USA Progressions is a real-time tracking software for the top-performing stocks on the US stock markets. It continuously monitors new investment opportunities on the Finviz platform and displays notifications when a promising stock is detected.

Key Features:

Real-Time Monitoring: The software automatically scrapes stock data from the Finviz website, analyzing stock prices and alert signals. Every minute, it retrieves up-to-date information on stocks.

Automatic Notifications: Whenever a new stock (not yet tracked) with promising signals is detected, a notification automatically appears in the bottom right corner of the screen. The notification includes the following information:

Stock symbol (Ticker)
Last price (Last)
Price change (Change)
Trading volume (Volume)
Specific stock signal (Signal)
These notifications automatically disappear after 2 seconds.

Intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI): The interface uses Tkinter and displays a dynamic table that presents all the tracked stocks. Each stock is shown with its last price, price change, trading volume, and signal.

Taskbar Icon: The software discreetly places itself in the Windows taskbar. You can click on the icon to show or hide the main window. You can exit the software via a context menu accessible from the taskbar icon.
